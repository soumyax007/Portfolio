  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a computer science student who's genuinely into building things, not just learning theory. I enjoy breaking down problems, figuring out how systems work under the hood, and turning ideas into working code. Whether it's experimenting with new tools or refining fundamentals, I'm always trying to level up my skills. </p>

  <p>Most of my focus is on writing clear, efficient code and understanding why things work, not just making them work. I like projects that challenge my thinking — especially anything involving algorithms, data, or real-world problem solving. I'm comfortable working solo, but I also enjoy collaborating and learning from others when building something bigger.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of coursework, I spend time exploring tech, improving my projects, and sharpening my problem-solving mindset. I'm aiming to grow into a developer who's not just technically strong, but also thoughtful in design and impact. This portfolio is a snapshot of that journey — where I started, what I'm building, and where I'm headed.</p>
